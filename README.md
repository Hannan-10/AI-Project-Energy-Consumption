# __Energy Consumption Analysis Project__
## Project Description
The project aims to analyze energy consumption data from a dataset named 'AIDataSetEnergyConsumption.csv'. It involves several steps, including data preprocessing, outlier detection, feature scaling, feature encoding, feature selection, and finally, model building and evaluation. The dataset includes features like building size, type, gross floor area and green mark status etc explained below. By accurately predicting energy usage patterns in buildings, the project seeks to enable informed decision-making for energy management and sustainability initiatives.
## Project Features
##
| Features | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Building name   | This feature represents the name or identifier of each building in the dataset. |
| Building address | This feature contains the address or location information of each building. |
| Building type    | This feature describes the type or category of the building, such as residential, commercial, industrial, etc. |
| Green mark status   | This categorical feature indicates whether a building has received a "Green Mark" certification or not. |
| Building size | This categorical feature describes the size category of the building, categorized as "Small" or "Large". |
| Gross Floor area | This feature represents the total area of the building's floor space, measured in square feet or square meters. |
| 2018 Energy Intensity | This feature indicates the energy intensity of the building in the year 2018. It serves as the target variable for energy consumption prediction. |

Project features such as __*'Building size'*__ and __*'Green mark status'*__ contains values __*small*__ or __*large*__ and __*no*__ or __*yes*__ which are later encoded into numerical values for modeling purposes and analysis.
